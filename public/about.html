<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Darius and I am undergoing a career change, transitioning from entrepreneurship in the hospitality industry to IT.

  So far, I have completed the course offered by Harvard - CS50P Introduction to Programming with Python. In this course, I had to solve around 40 problems and present a final project. The projects are on my GitHub page.
 
</p>

<p>Currently, I am learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to prepare for an internship in web development.
  I did complete some projects in HTML and CSS but now I am following Angela Yu's Web Development Bootcamp on Udemy for more in depth learning about this awesome field of web development </p>

<p> 
  
  
  I am eager to learn new things and work in Web Development or Software Development. Looking forward to learning!
